Answer The Following Questions:

1. How many Principal Components do you think is needed to give the best fit to each of the model?
20. Although my result gives me best prediction at 5 for each
Because the cross validation score rise quickly before 10, and from 10-20 it's still not stable.
But after 20 the score becomes stable and it can give the best fit to the model.

2. Would you choose Naive Bayes or Gaussian Class Conditionals?
I would choose GCC

3. How did you decide the above were good choices and why?
Mine was not able to be decided, there are some problem in my code but no tiem for debug, so I noted the correct way in my opinion.
But in general I would like to pick GCC as it will likely give higher validation score with smaller dimension.

4. Looking at the training and validation scores, they collapse into constant functions as we 
   increase the dimensionality. Can you explain why this is happening?
As PC increasing, the effect of noises and outliers will decrease.

5. Looking at the reconstructed images using the best dimensionality of each model, do you think 
   you can predict whether a given image is an eye easily? Why?
No, because my reconstructed has something inside which is not an eye. 
Also it has wrong classification on non eye image. The picture is still blurry and it's likely to make an error.

6. Why would dimensionality reduction help produce a better model?
The main reason ism dimensionality reduction can hugely reduce the model complexity and reduce the calcualtion workload.
This efficiency will be more obvious when facing larger data.
